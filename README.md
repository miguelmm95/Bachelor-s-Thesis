# Bachelor's Thesis

In this repository you will find my bachelor's thesis: "**Design and implementation of an artificial intelligence for a horror videogame in Unreal Engine 5**", in which I obtained a score of **9.5** out of 10, and was nominated for an **honorary certificate**.

In this project I analyze and study the various tools provided by Unreal Engine for **AI** implementation, and how I can use them to implement an NPC for a horror video game reminiscent of enemies from games like Alien: Isolation and Resident Evil 2 Remake.
